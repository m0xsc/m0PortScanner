## m0PortScanner

m0PortScanner is a simple and easy-to-use port scanner using nmap. It is designed to quickly identify open ports on a target system, allowing for easy reconnaissance and vulnerability assessment.

## Getting Started

1. To get started with m0PortScanner, simply clone the repository to your local machine:

    $ git clone https://github.com/m0xsc/m0PortScanner.git

2. Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the m0PortScanner directory:

    $ cd m0PortScanner

3. You can then run the m0PortScanner script using the following command:

    $ ./m0PortScanner.sh

This will prompt you to enter the IP address or hostname of the target system, as well as the range of ports you wish to scan. The script will then use nmap to scan the specified ports on the target system and display the results.
